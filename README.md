_Centralize all of your games within a simple interface._

## About Vitrine

Vitrine is a modern game library using the Electron framework and the IGDB database to display games installed on your computer. It scans your Steam games folder to retrieve your Steam library, use the IGDB database to provide details about your games (developer, publisher, release date, screenshots, ...) and display them in a smooth and simple interface. It can also measure the time spend playing a game and can be synchronized to Steam playing times.

## Beta

As it is in beta, Vitrine only currently supports Steam, but in the future it will also work with Origin, Battle.net and will provide a module to automatically detect emulated games. The UI is also in very early stage of development and will change within future updates. Feel free to test the application yourself and seek for a bug! If you can find one, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/paul-roman/vitrine/issues/new).
