## About Vitrine
Vitrine is a modern game library using the Electron framework and the IGDB database to find and display games installed on your computer.
It can automatically scans your computer folders to retrieve your Steam, Origin and Battle.net games, uses the IGDB database to provide details about your games (developer, publisher, release date, screenshots, ...) and display them in a smooth and simple interface.
It can also measure the time spend playing a game and can be synchronized to Steam playing times.
A module is also provided for emulated games, allowing you to define which emulators are installed on your computer and find games roms inside a folder corresponding to that emulator.

## Beta
As it is in beta, Vitrine only currently supports Steam, Origin and Battle.net but in the future it will also work with GOG Games and others.
The UI is also in an early stage of development and will change within future updates.
Feel free to test the application yourself and seek for a bug! If you can find one, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/paul-roman/vitrine/issues/new).
